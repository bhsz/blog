*The following is by no means financial advice, nor do I have experience in professional finance. They are simply my personal notes. This post does not go into how to get started with investing, there are many comprehensive guides available on the web about that.*

Savings are very important. They provide financial cushion and it is absolutely critical for unexpected expenses. However, having all your money stored in the bank is not a good idea. Its value worths less each year as inflation > interest earned.

With investing, it really doesn't matter if you start with nothing. It remains that **you should start as early as possible and let the power of compounding work its magic!**
