# Personal Finance

*The following is by no means financial advice, nor do I have experience in professional finance. They are simply my personal notes.*
<br>
<br>

**General Terminology & Knowledge**
- Initial loan is also called your mortgage principal.
- Debt-to-income ratio is total monthly debt divided by total monthly income.
    - As a rule of thumb, â‰¤35% is good, â‰¥50% is very bad!
    - 43% is the magic number - the highest ratio (in most cases) for an individual to still be able to secure a mortgage.
- High credit score, high down payment and low debt-to-income ratio leads to lower interest rates.

> Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.

**50-30-20 Rule for Budgetting**
- Of your **after-tax income**...
    - **At most 50%** for **needs**
    - **At most** **30%** for **wants**
    - **At least** ****20%** for **savings**
- You should start using your savings to secure at least 3-6 months of emergency funds first, then focus on investments, retirement funds and other financial goals.
    - How much do I need in my emergency fund?
    There is no one-size-fit-all here, I think the more the better. It provides a cushion from financial stress from unexpected expenses. I think it would be safe to have at least 1.25x 3-6 months of your monthly expenses covered.

> The earlier you invest, the more powerful you compound.

**Investment**
- Before investing, make sure that you have **emergency funds** in place.
- **Start small**, but make sure you **actually start**! Money in the bank gets eaten away by inflation.
- Consider your financial goals and then check on how to reach them.

- Rule of thumb - invest **10-15%** of your income.
- What to invest in? That's a topic for another day ðŸ˜‰

> Never buy a house you canâ€™t afford.

**28/36 Rule on Debt**
- Of your **pre-tax income**...
    - **No more than** **28%** for **mortgage payment**
    - **No more than** **36%** for **total debt**

> Buying a new car is often a bad financial decision, they depreciate in value significantly and quickly.

**How much should I spend on cars?**
- **As little as possible!** Consider getting a good used car.
- In terms of numbers, expenses should be capped at **10-15% of monthly income**.
- Note that this includes loan repayments, maintenance fees, fuel, insurance premiums etc.
