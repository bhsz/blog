Many of us are chasing the same dream - capture opportunities, produce value, scale up, climb the ladder until you reach the top. However, there's a fundamental flaw with this, **we don't have infinite resources.**

It is time that we realise that valuing our economy in terms of GDP and always seeking growth is not sustainable. [Kate Raworth proposed a new economic model where we are not to grow, but to thrive - the Doughnut Economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw). As an oversimplification, this model tells us that our total production should be sufficient for everyone to have a baseline standard of living, yet not too much such that it exceeds the [planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html). Production within this region will be sustainable, allowing humanity to thrive essentially forever.
