*This post is simply a summary from Dean Yeong's article - [4 Simple Hacks to Stronger Willpower](https://www.deanyeong.com/article/4-hacks-to-stronger-willpower)*

All the goals that we set out to achieve in life require consistent attention and action over a long period of time - it is truly not a sprint, but a marathon.

Here are some simple hacks to help you on your journey :

- **Start your day off doing what matters most**

    Your willpower is at its peak after a good night's rest. Want to lose weight? Take action early in the morning before your regular schedule.

- **Mini habits can snowball**

    > We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
    -Aristotle

    We often have trouble taking action towards our goals because they seem unrealistically far away. The trick is to slowly build up from habits that are so small that we have no reason or excuse to ignore them. Going back to the context of losing weight, you can simply start with just walking for 10 minutes a day.

- **Reward yourself**

    Map out the milestones for your goal(s) and reward yourself proportionately depending on how big/small they are. Been eyeing a new pair of headphones? Make the purchase after you've (for example) lost 3% of body fat. However, you must be very careful with this system - never reward yourself with counterproductive behaviours. Don't give yourself a week off after exercising for a few days. Remember, the key to achieving our goals is to be consistent!

- **Fuel yourself mentally & physically**
    - Everyone knows that sleep is very important, but most of us take it for granted. We sleep in cycles, each lasting between 75 to 90 minutes. We should get at least 4 cycles of sleep for baseline cognitive performance, but ideally 5 to 6 cycles. An average adult needs 15 minutes to fall asleep, so we need to factor that in as well. It is also important that we don't time our sleep such that we wake up in the middle of a cycle, that is why we sometimes wake up feeling like we've been hit by a truck. Assuming that your cycle lasts 90 minutes and you're aiming for 4 cycles, you'd want to stay in bed for about 6 hours and 15 minutes (90mins * 4 + 15mins). Play around with the timings to find your cycle - mine is about 85 minutes.
    - Eat well to fuel your body, make sure you're getting enough macro- and micro-nutrients. [Michael Pollan sums it up pretty well](https://www.welcometothetable.coop/food-lifestyle/michael-pollan-three-simple-rules-for-eating) - "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." This in fact encompasses personal nutrition and sustainable diets, but that's a topic for another day ðŸ˜‰
